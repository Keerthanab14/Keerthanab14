A pre-final year student at Sir MVIT, Bangalore pursuing B.E in Electronics and Communication Engineering graduating in July 2022.

I have looked into and worked around an immense variety of technologies such as Java and Springboot,chatbots using Dialogflow, building websites using Full-stack technologies, Data Analytics and Cloud Computing to name a few alongside being pretty active and participating in events that encourage me to learn. I'm always willing to participate in something that helps me learn and grow.
